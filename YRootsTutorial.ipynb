    "\n",
    "When a function in a system is a polynomial, it may be useful to pass it in as a YRoots `MultiCheb` or `MultiPower` object, which corresponds to a multivariate polynomials in the Chebyshev basis or in the power basis (respectively). These objects may be more cumbersome to create, but they have a special `evaluate_grid` method which allows for faster approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polynomials in $n$-dimensions are represented by an $n$-dimensional array of coefficients. For a system with three variables, the $(i,j,k)$ spot in the coefficient tensor corresponds to the coefficients of $x^iy^jz^k$ in the power basis or $T_i(x)T_j(y)T_k(z)$ in the Chebyshev basis. It is usually easiest to construct this coefficient tensor by initializing a tensor of zeros and then setting each nonzero coefficient to the correct value.\n",
